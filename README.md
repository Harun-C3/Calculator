Simple Calculator with a User Interface

This project is a basic calculator application developed using Python and the Kivy framework. It features a graphical user interface (UI) that allows users to perform standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The intuitive UI is built using Kivy's widgets and layout tools, with buttons for digits and operations, along with a display to show inputs and results. This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, event-driven design, and UI development with Kivy.
